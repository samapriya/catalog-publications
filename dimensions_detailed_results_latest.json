We are grateful to Eva Arvizu and Jordyn Porter, who visually interpreted tile drainage points via the Google Earth aerial images. We thank Dan Jaynes (Iowa State University), Ghane Ehsan and Jason Piwarshi (Michigan State University), and Nathan Trosen (Moore Engineering, Inc.) for providing ground truth points for this research. We also thank Eunsang Cho (NASA, Goddard Space Flight Center), who shared code and guidance on the machine learning algorithm and David Roy (Michigan State University), Yanhua Xie (The University of Oklahoma) and Jill Deines (Pacific Northwest National Laboratory) for their valuable suggestions to improve this work. The BdSW tile drainage permit records were obtained from the BdSW district in Minnesota (www. bdswd.com) and SD and ND tile drainage records are publicly available from the USGS Science Base website (www. sciencebase.gov). All satellite and input data used are available through the Google Earth Engine code editor (code.earthengine.google.com) and the awesome-gee-community-catalog (gee-community-catalog.org/), except for soil drainage class, HLR, and distance to the nearest canals and ditches, which are freely available from SSURGO, USGS HLR, and NHD datasets. The PAW layers are derived from POLARIS dataset. The Python scripts for generating PAW layers and the R scripts for selecting variables, implementing the random forest model and visualizing the figures, are available on HydroShare. The SEETileDrain product is also available on HydroShare, along with the probability map. https://www.hydroshare.org/resource/4c8af0c89d2b4686808bcf9c6f7c0da3/ https://doi.org/10.4211/hs.4c8af0c89d2b4686808bcf9c6f7c0da3.",
